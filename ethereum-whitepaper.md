# Ethereum: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform.
By Vitalik Buterin (2014).

## History

- e-cash largely failed to gain traction because
of their reliance on a centralized intermediary.
- 1998 b-money became the first proposal to
introduce the idea of creating money through 
solving computational puzzles as well as 
descentralized consensus. The solution was scant on details
as to how decentralized consensus could actually be 
 implemented.
- currency is a first-to-file application:
	where the order of transactions is often
 of critical importance, decentralized currencies 
require a solution to decentralized consensus.
- **The problem with pre-Bitcoin currency protocols 
faced is, that in an anonymous setting
 such security margin are vulnerable to sybill attacks, where a single attacker creates 
thousands of simulated nodes on a server or botnet
 and uses these nodes to unilaterally secure a
 majority share.**

## Bitcoin As A State Transaction System

- From a technical standpoint, the Bitcoin ledger can be thought of as state transition system,
 where there is a "state" consisting of the ownership 
status of all existing bitcoin and a "state transitcion function" 
that takes a state and a transaction and outputs a new 
state which is the result.
